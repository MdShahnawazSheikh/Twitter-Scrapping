# Twitter Scrapping

First of all Thank You very much for considering my application for this role and giving me a chance to prove myself.

Modules used: snscrape and pandas

The program can be made faster by using Multithreading, dividing the list of links into chunks and then executing them at once.
However I haven't used Multithreading as I have very little knowledge about it.

Also I have used snscrape because I did not have a twitter api at the time being and sncrape does not require one to work.

Output can be found in output.csv
